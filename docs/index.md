# 🌐 Agentics

Agentics is a lightweight, Python-native framework for building **structured and massively parallel agentic workflows** using Pydantic models and **transducible functions** . 

A **transducible function** is an LLM-powered, type-safe transformation between Pydantic models. Agentics lets you:

- Define these transformations **declaratively**  
- Compose them into **pipelines**  
- Execute them at scale using an asynchronous **Map–Reduce** execution engine ⚙️

Under the hood, Agentics is grounded in **Logical Transduction Algebra (LTA)**, a logico-mathematical formalism that guarantees:

- ✅ Composability  
- ✅ Explainability  
- ✅ Stability of LLM-based transformations  

The result is a way to build agentic systems that are:

- **Typed** – every step has explicit input/output schemas 📐  
- **Composable** – pipelines are built from reusable transducible functions 🧩  
- **Traceable** – outputs carry evidence back to input fields 🔍  
- **Scalable** – async `amap` / `areduce` primitives support large workloads 🚀  
- **Minimal** – no heavy orchestrators: just types, functions, and data 🪶  

Agentics code is **simple, predictable, and robust**, and is easy to embed into modern ecosystems (LangFlow, LangChain, CrewAI, MCP, etc.) 🤝.

## 🔑 Key Features

### ⚙️ Transducible Functions (Core Abstraction)

Define LLM-powered transformations as first-class functions:

- 🧾 Typed input and output via Pydantic models  
- 🛡️ Automatic schema validation and type-constrained generation  
- 🪜 Composable into higher-level workflows and chains  

---

### 🧱 Typed State Containers - a.k.a. Agentics (AG) 

Wrap data into typed state collections so that every row or document carries a concrete Pydantic type:

- Safe, batch-level operations ✅  
- Clear semantics over datasets and intermediate states 📊  
- Input/output from DBs, CSV and Json
- Ideal to represent tabular/structured data

---

### 🚀 Async Map–Reduce Execution

Run transducible functions over large collections using:

- ⚡ `amap` for massively parallel application  
- 📉 `areduce` for aggregations and global summaries  

Designed to scale on multi-core or distributed execution backends 🖥️🖥️🖥️.

---

### 🧩 Dynamic Type & Function Composition

Create new workflows on the fly:

- 🔄 Merge or refine types dynamically  
- 🧬 Compose transducible functions declaratively  
- 🔀 Build polymorphic or adaptive pipelines driven by data and instructions  

---

### 🔍 Explainable & Traceable Inference

Each generated attribute can be traced back to:

- Specific input fields 🧷  
- The specific transducible function or step that produced it 🧠  

This enables **auditable, debuggable** LLM reasoning across the pipeline.

---

### 🛡️ End-to-End Type Safety

Pydantic models are enforced at every boundary:

- ✅ Validation on input loading  
- ✅ Validation after each transducible function  
- ✅ Predictable runtime behavior and clear failure modes  

---

### 🔌 Tool Integration

Agentics is fully compatible with Model Context Protocol (MCP) and expose external tools and knowledge to transducible functions:

- 🌐 Web / search tools  
- 🗄️ Databases & vector stores  
- 💻 Code execution backends  
- 🔗 MCP-based tools  

---

### ✨ Minimalistic, Pythonic API

The framework is intentionally small:

- 🚫 No custom DSL to learn  
- 🐍 Just Python functions, Pydantic models, and a few core primitives  
- 🌉 Easy to embed into existing stacks (LangFlow nodes, CrewAI agents, MCPs, etc.)
